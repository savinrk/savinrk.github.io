Here are a collection of some tools that I think are worthwhile learning for someone in grad school (or whose work entails large amounts of time on a computer, particularly typing). Most of them will probably have a (relatively) steep learning-curve, but will yield immense benefits over time in terms of productivity. 

Generally speaking, the motivation behind learning these tools is to acquire a deep(er) understanding of the task at hand and being able to execute desired actions at a fast pace, so that the gap between thinking and execution is prompt and (perhaps more importantly) precise. With all of these tools, basic usage is manageable within a few weeks. Additionally, extensive help is available online for all of these tools on StackOverflow and other places, due to their widespread popularity, should one get stuck. The benefits will, however, exponentially accumulate with persistent use. The user is likely to pass through an inflection point, beyond which reverting back to previous tools (of the [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) variety) seems highly restrictive. 

Unless you are a mid-career academic with a well-established research plan (with students/associates to help you with the everyday nitty-gritty), it is almost guaranteed that these tools will improve your work life.

### LaTeX

#### What is it? 
  
  - software for typesetting documents built by Leslie Lamport, on top of Donald Knuth's TeX system for math-heavy documents
  - as opposed to MS Word etc..., allows for more fine-grained control of the content and layout of the document
  - can be used to create beautiful documents, presentations, posters and so on for academic and general uses
  - has widespread math and font support 

#### Why should I use it? 

  - you want your documents to look professional (especially math)
  - you care about cross-compatibilty and how things look on different devices 
  - you don't want to painstakingly edit each paragraph when moving an image affects the layout of the whole document
  - you want to be able to control each element of the file (in posters, presentations etc.)  
  - you want to collaborate with someone who's on Linux (and can't access Microsoft products on their local computer)



#### What should I know before jumping in? 

  - requires a programmatic mindset&emdash;unlike Word or LibreOffice Writer, content and layout of each pixel is controlled by the user
  - endlessly flexible, but may require lots of searching and trial-and-error
  - [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is an excellent web-based tool that allows for a relatively pain-free introduction to $LaTeX$ and has lots of templates to get started, also useful for collaboration
  - helpful links: [Overleaf's guide for absolute beginners](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes), [LearnLatex.org](https://www.learnlatex.org/en/)


### Python

#### What is it? 
 - general-purpose programming language with high configurability
 - has extensive packages for practically all academic analysis needs

#### Why should I use it? 

  - for processing, cleaning, and analysing large datasets fast 
  - you want better graphics than what Excel, STATA etc. provide
  - for sharing your code with others
  - you want to stay up-to-date with latest advancements in your field (which are more likely to use either R or Python for analyses)

#### What should I know before jumping in? 

  - pandas (data processing), seaborn (graphics),  and scikit-learn (machine learning) probably cover a lot of what you might require, and are relatively straightforward to learn
  - if you get stuck, don't fret. Someone else has likely had the same problem and it's been solved on StackOverflow. 
  - to avoid frustration in the future, look into [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started.html) for environment management and Jupyter notebooks when you're starting out
  - every single thing you do is likely to require web searches and trial-and-error

### Vim 

#### What is it? 

 - extremely fast, highly-configurable, old-school text-editing software that is based on the [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor)) editor developed by Bill Joy in 1976

#### Why should I use it? 
  - decreases the time between thought and execution in everyday editing of both text and code(this cannot be overstated)
  - lots of programs across multiple domains (web browsers, code editors, etc.) allow you to apply vim shortcuts, which significantly enhances usage
  - [for coders by Simon Spati](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vim-language-and-motions-explained/)


#### What should I know before jumping in?
  - to exit (without saving changes) use *Esc, :, q!, Enter* 
  - there are two modes: *insert* (for when you're actually editing the document, accessible with the *i* key) and *command* (which allows you for more general interactions, accessible with the *Esc* key)
  - the terminal interface can be daunting in the beginning, you can get started with Gvim, which provides a graphical interface (search for 'gvim' on [this page](https://www.vim.org/download.php))

### Github 

#### What is it? 

 - a platform where you can create, store, manage, and share your code

#### Why should I use it? 
  - you write code for your analysis and need to keep track of changes made to it
  - you want an accessible interface where you can share your code with others or collaborate on a project
  - you don't want to deal with the messiness of having multiple versions of your codefiles on your computer after each change  
  - although version control might not seem necessary, it is *absolutely* necessary, regardless of what code you're writing

#### What should I know before jumping in?
  
  - the basics are relatively straightforward if you're not collaborating with a large team on the project

### Obsidian 

#### What is it? 

 - highly customizable note-taking app

#### Why should I use it? 
  - hyperlinks allow for [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) effects
  - has a journalling feature
  - multiple plugins for customization, habit-tracking and other uses

#### What should I know before jumping in?
  
  - like with the previous tools, benefits accrue from consistency
