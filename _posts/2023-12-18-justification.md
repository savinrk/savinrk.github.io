Hello, Welcome, and Namaste! 

There are two main reasons for starting this site. First, because it's possible and I wanted to, and second, because what is measured, improves.[^1]



## Reason One: Facility and Desire

Back in the day (circa 2013-15, which might be laughably *still in the day* to some readers), I used to tweet a lot. These days, however, I don't see much use in any social media&mdash;believing, rather firmly, that there is no net good in too much engagement with those platforms. In the interesting times we live in, it is perhaps better (or more rewarding, at least) to dwell on things you actually want to consciously consume. Thus, I thought it might be beneficial to have a space (one which I can, to a large extent, have control over) to interface with the world, should anyone be interested in the things I am. 

This site will be very much inspired by those of [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/), [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/), [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) and so on. There was some other individual who had a similar setup with much shorter posts (whose name unfortunately escapes me presently) who also motivated me. So, the posts are mostly going to be short, probably. The goal is to log random thoughts on diverse topics and not to have rigorously edited manuscripts&mdash;although such opportunities may arise.  

## Reason Two: Measurement and Improvement

The only major prior experience I have with HTML is from the 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> grade back in Nepal. It seemed fairly intuitive then but we never really moved beyond the basics. Having dabbled with HTML and CSS once or twice in the past few years (very much on a need basis) in grad school, I felt like it might be of use to get more hands-on with these tools. Since switching $LaTeX$ for all my typesetting needs, my `Markdown` skills have also gathered signficant rust, which will hopefully improve during the course of maintaining this site. I find it much to learn things while doing them[^2], which is further motivation.

## Recursion

This site is built using the excellent [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master) theme on the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The only [rubies](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [gems](https://rubygems.org/) I know, I can't afford on a grad student's stipend. However, setting it up on my local machine and publishing on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) has been fairly straightforward. Regrettably, much of the modern web is [extremely](https://mgearon.com/performance/the-web-is-bloated/) [bloated](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/fix-javascript-bloat)[^3], and I hope the browsing experience (*content aside*) is tolerable on your end.
