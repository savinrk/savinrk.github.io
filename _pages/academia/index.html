<p> This page provides short introductions to my completed research projects. My doctoral dissertation is focused on applying Machine Learning techniques to international trade and related areas. Besides that, I have also worked on other econometric techniques in the fields of health and climate change. </p>

				<h2><strong>Worker Motivations and Productivity in Crowdsourced Markets</strong></h2>
				<p>For my <a href="https://esploro.libs.uga.edu/esploro/outputs/graduate/WORKER-MOTIVATIONS-IN-CROWDSOURCING-MARKETS-AND/9949365962102959">Master's thesis</a>, I performed an experiment (under the guidance of <a href="https://agecon.uga.edu/people/faculty/gregory-colson.html"> Dr. Greg Colson</a>) to anlayse how worker motivations in joining crowdsourced platforms affect their productivity. To achieve this, an experiment was setup in the crowdsourcing platform <a href="https://www.mturk.com/"> MTurk</a> wherein workers were allowed to complete tasks for a nominal fee. Upon selecting the posted Human Intelligence Task (or HIT) in the MTurk website, workers were first presented with a survery that asked them about their background (income, location, age, education and so on) and their motivations behind joining MTurk. Following this, they were prompted to complete <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282802762024700">Holt and Laury (2002)</a> style lottery decision task  featuring a list of 10 decisions between paired gambles 'A' and 'B'. The workers were asked which gamble they would rather take. Then, they were provided with 14 choice scenarios to elicit their preferences on which HIT they would rather participate in given the choices which varied across types, earnings, and time required for completion. Some workers were also prompted with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheap_talk">Cheap Talk</a> script explaining the phenomneon of <i>hypothetical bias</i> and why they should avoid it, in order to determine whether that could improve work quality. </p>
				<p>The primary goal of this task was to ascertain whether there any differences in productivity between workers that are <i>intrinsically</i> motivated (i.e., those that take up the work because the task itself is inherently interesting or enjoyable) or <i>extrinsically</i> motivated (i.e, those that work because it allows the fulfilment of other outcomes- usually income). The difference in productivity is identified by examining worker accuracy across the lottery decision task and choice experiments. The lottery decision task is designed such that economic theories of risk aversion suggest an individual should never switch back to column 'A' once they pick 'B'. Thus, any subsequent switch from 'B' to 'A' is classified as an error. Similarly, errors were identified in the choice experiment based on the selection of the strictly worse option (based on the task attributes) and inconsistencies in choice when faced with the same problem.</p>
				<p>Results showed that while the intrinsically motivated workers were less likely to make a switching error in the lottery decision task, the coefficients were not statistically significant. Additionally, intrinsically motivated indviduals were also better at avoiding <i>strictly dominated</i> options in the choice experiment (significant at the 5-percent level) and making fewer inconsistent choices (not statistically significant). The primary issue we faced in this anlaysis was due to the large proportion of the workers falling under the "ambivalent" group- where it was unclear whether they were intrinsically or extrinsically motivated. </p>


				<h2> <strong><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jaa2.69">Policy Uncertainties and Agricultural Trade</a></strong></h2>
				<p> This work (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jaa2.69">published</a> in collaboration with my advisor <a href="https://agecon.uga.edu/people/faculty/gopinath-munisamy.html"> Dr. Gopinath Munisamy</a>, and <a href="https://www.bse.vt.edu/people/faculty/feras-batarseh.html"> Dr. Feras A Batarseh</a> from Virginia Tech) discusses the impacts of policy uncertainty on agricultural trade- specifically the impacts of economic and trade policy uncertainty in driving anomalies (outliers) in trade. Using a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier"> Naive Bayes classifier</a>,  outliers in monthly agricultural trade data are identified and subsequently classified as having arised from stuructural (i.e., production-related) sources or policy uncertainty (i.e, concerns about the future of policy). The latter group is further classified as economic-policy (EPU) related outliers  and trade-policy (TPU) related outliers. Then, the effects of policy uncertainty on agriculture are analyzed by using two primary metrics: intensity (i.e., the size of the deviation from the trend) and duration (i.e., the persistence of these effects across mutliple subsequent periods). Results indicate that the effects of EPU and TPU are distinct from production related changes. Compared to changes to the supply-side, EPU is associated with a significant decrease in trade which supports the existing literature on the contractionary effects of uncertainty. TPU, on the other hand, is associated with an increase in trade suggesting anticipatory stockpiling. <p>
				<p>Trade data are obtained from a propreitary subscription to IHS-Markit, policy uncertainty measures are obtained from the <a href="http://www.policyuncertainty.com/"> policy uncertainty website </a> maintained by Scott R. Baker, Nicholas Bloom, and Steven J. Davis, and production data are obtained from the <a href="https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html#/app/downloads"> Production, Supply, and Distribution database </a> maintained by USDA- Foreign Ag. Service. All of the coding was done in R.   </p>

				<h1> <strong>Networks and International Trade</strong></h1>
				<div class="figure> <img src= "/assets/images/corn2022.png" alt = "corn trade network in 2022"> <p> Sample network (corn, 2022) </p></div>
				<p> This work examines the structure and evolution of international food supply chains using a network-based approach. In doing so, countries are represented by the nodes of the network while their trade relatiosnhips are represented as the edges connecting the nodes. Using this directed, weighted network-representation of the food supply chain, changes in the network are identified across three areas:<p>
					<ol>
						<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality"> Centrality Measures</a></li>
						<ul>
							<li> <strong>Degree Centrality:</strong> number of trading partners for a country </li>
							<li> <strong> Betweenness Centrality:</strong> tendency of a country to act as a bridge (facilitator) of trade between other countries, and </li>
							<li> <strong>Laplacian Centrality:</strong> influence of a country on the network, determined by the change in Laplacian energy when the country is removed.  </li>
						</ul>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure">Community Detection</a></li>
							<p>The identification of densely connected clusters within the network based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity">modularity</a> maximization. The basic principle is that countries within a community should be densely interconnected while connections across communities should be sparse. </p>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient"> Clustering Coefficient</a></li>
							<p>A measure of the interconnectedness of the network. Determined by identifying the total number of "triangles" observed in the network compared to the total possible number of triangles.</p>
					</ol>			
				<p>Trade data on three product groups- meats, grains, and edible oils- as well as soybean are obtained from a propreitary subscription to IHS-Markit and from the UN-Comtrade database. This project makes extensive use of various graphing libraries such as networkx, igraph, gravis, and so on available for Python. </p>
