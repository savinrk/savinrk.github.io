		        <h2> <strong>Policy Uncertainties and Agricultural Trade</strong></h2>
		        <p> This study (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jaa2.69">published</a> in collaboration with my advisor <a href="https://agecon.uga.edu/people/faculty/gopinath-munisamy.html"> Dr. Gopinath Munisamy</a>, and <a href="https://www.bse.vt.edu/people/faculty/feras-batarseh.html"> Dr. Feras A Batarseh</a> from Virginia Tech) discusses the impacts of policy uncertainty on agricultural trade- specifically the impacts of economic and trade policy uncertainty in driving anomalies (outliers) in trade. Using a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier"> Naive Bayes classifier</a>,  outliers in monthly agricultural trade data are identified and subsequently classified as having arised from stuructural (i.e., production-related) sources or policy uncertainty (i.e, concerns about the future of policy). The latter group is further classified as economic-policy (EPU) related outliers  and trade-policy (TPU) related outliers. Then, the effects of policy uncertainty on agriculture are analyzed by using two primary metrics: intensity (i.e., the size of the deviation from the trend) and duration (i.e., the persistence of these effects across mutliple subsequent periods). Results indicate that the effects of EPU and TPU are distinct from production related changes. Compared to changes to the supply-side, EPU is associated with a significant decrease in trade which supports the existing literature on the contractionary effects of uncertainty. TPU, on the other hand, is associated with an increase in trade suggesting anticipatory stockpiling. <p>
		        <p>Trade data are obtained from a propreitary subscription to IHS-Markit, policy uncertainty measures are obtained from the <a href="http://www.policyuncertainty.com/"> policy uncertainty website </a> maintained by Scott R. Baker, Nicholas Bloom, and Steven J. Davis, and production data are obtained from the <a href="https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html#/app/downloads"> Production, Supply, and Distribution database </a> maintained by USDA- Foreign Ag. Service. All of the models were developed in R. </p>

						<h2> <strong>Climate Change Adaptation and its Impacts on Farm Income and Downside Risk Exposure</a></strong></h2>
						<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666916122000305"> This paper</a> published in <i>Resources, Environment, and Sustainability</i> in 2022 investigates the impact of climate change adaptation (defined by farmers' decision to adopt improved practices to mitigate the effects of climate change) on farm revenue and risk exposure. Using household survey data from Nepal, this study finds that climate change adaptation leads to a 21.6% increase in farm revenue and a 6.4% reduction in downside risk exposure. Further, differences in outcomes amongst adapting and non-adapting peer households are also identified.</p>
						<p>To address the issue of self-selection and omitted variable bias (which could lead to potential endogeneity in the model), a control function (CF) approach is employed within an endogenous switching regression (ESR) framework, following <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407615001839">Murtazashvili and Woolridge (2016)</a>. Thus, the analysis proceeds in two steps. The first step is a probit estimation of the (climate change) adaptation decision, and the second step uses the CF approach in the crop revenue equation where the adaptation decision from the first step is the only endogenous variable. Combined with instrumental variables estimation (using instruments that have been validated in the extant literature- distance to road, distance to extension service center, and climate information), this CF approach estimates all parameters under standard assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to deal with self-selection bias using the control function approach in analyzing climate change adaptation. This study used Stata for all data preparation and analysis steps.</p>

						<h2> <strong>Heterogeneities in Consumer Diet Quality and Health Outcomes of Consumers by Store Choice and Income </a></strong></h2>
						<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/4/1046">This paper</a> published in <i>Nutrients</i> in 2021 examines the associations between diet quality and weight-related health outcomes in the United States using the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/foodaps-national-household-food-acquisition-and-purchase-survey.aspx">FoodAPS survey</a>. Findings indicate that larger expenditures at convenience stores and restaurants are linked with poorer diet quality based on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30146071/">HEI-2015 scores</a> and higher BMI. Further analysis also shows that low-income households that spent a larger share of their budget at convenience stores and fast-food restaurants are more likely to be obese.</p>
						<p>The associations of food budget shares with nutritional quality and BMI were identified using a multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) model and the probability of obesity was estimated using a binary probit model. All of the data preparation and analysis was performed in STATA. </p>

						<h2><strong>Worker Motivations and Productivity in Crowdsourced Markets</strong></h2>
						<p>For my <a href="https://esploro.libs.uga.edu/esploro/outputs/graduate/WORKER-MOTIVATIONS-IN-CROWDSOURCING-MARKETS-AND/9949365962102959">Master's thesis</a>, I performed an experiment (under the guidance of <a href="https://agecon.uga.edu/people/faculty/gregory-colson.html"> Dr. Greg Colson</a>) to anlayse how worker motivations in joining crowdsourced platforms affect their productivity. To achieve this, an experiment was setup in the crowdsourcing platform <a href="https://www.mturk.com/"> MTurk</a> wherein workers were allowed to complete tasks for a nominal fee. Upon selecting the posted Human Intelligence Task (or HIT) in the MTurk website, workers were first presented with a survery that asked them about their background (income, location, age, education and so on) and their motivations behind joining MTurk. Following this, they were prompted to complete <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282802762024700">Holt and Laury (2002)</a> style lottery decision task  featuring a list of 10 decisions between paired gambles 'A' and 'B'. The workers were asked which gamble they would rather take. Then, they were provided with 14 choice scenarios to elicit their preferences on which HIT they would rather participate in given the choices which varied across types, earnings, and time required for completion. Some workers were also prompted with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheap_talk">Cheap Talk</a> script explaining the phenomneon of <i>hypothetical bias</i> and why they should avoid it, in order to determine whether that could improve work quality. </p>
						<p>The primary goal of this task was to ascertain whether there any differences in productivity between workers that are <i>intrinsically</i> motivated (i.e., those that take up the work because the task itself is inherently interesting or enjoyable) or <i>extrinsically</i> motivated (i.e, those that work because it allows the fulfilment of other outcomes- usually income). The difference in productivity is identified by examining worker accuracy across the lottery decision task and choice experiments. The lottery decision task is designed such that economic theories of risk aversion suggest an individual should never switch back to column 'A' once they pick 'B'. Thus, any subsequent switch from 'B' to 'A' is classified as an error. Similarly, errors were identified in the choice experiment based on the selection of the strictly worse option (based on the task attributes) and inconsistencies in choice when faced with the same problem.</p>
						<p>Results showed that while the intrinsically motivated workers were less likely to make a switching error in the lottery decision task, the coefficients were not statistically significant. Additionally, intrinsically motivated indviduals were also better at avoiding <i>strictly dominated</i> options in the choice experiment (significant at the 5-percent level) and making fewer inconsistent choices (not statistically significant). The primary issue we faced in this anlaysis was due to the large proportion of the workers falling under the "ambivalent" group- where it was unclear whether they were intrinsically or extrinsically motivated. The tasks were designed using HTML and all of the analysis was performed in R.</p>
